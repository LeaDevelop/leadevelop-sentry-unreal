# LeaDevelop sentry-unreal enhancements

Early summer 2025 I was exploring source of Sentry unreal plugin and I started adding custom tags to my self-hosted instance where I'm experimenting and prototyping different options. 
I am continuing that [adventure](https://leadevelop.net/blog/monitor-unreal-projects-in-sentry/) and am at the point of creating custom plugin. This will make updates between official Sentry plugin and own easier and makes it easier for anybody else to pick it up as well.

Custom tags has been confirmed working, but the plugin creation including that source code will be my first Plugin journey from ground up in UE world. I'll be on in coming weekends and see how far I get.
Until you don't see release version in the repository, the plugin is not functional. Stay tuned ðŸ¤“ and feel free to reach out in Discord - LeaDevelop. I'm probably listening to music and reading up [Plugins](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/plugins-in-unreal-engine) docs at the moment.
